          <p><strong>Question</strong>: What is coffee?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Coffee beans are the dried seed of a cherry-like fruit that grows on the coffee shrub (plant), genus: Coffea.</p>

<ul>
<li>The fruit begins as a blossom, resembling a jasmine flower, which lasts only a few days.</li>
<li>After the flower falls from the branch what remains is a small green coffee cherry.</li>
<li>As the cherries grow they turn yellow then red, a deeper red, then almost to a black. </li>
<li>Within 6-9 months the cherries are ready to be picked and shipped for processing.</li>
</ul><hr><h2>
<a name="where-is-coffee-grown" class="anchor" href="#where-is-coffee-grown"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where is coffee grown?</h2>

<p>Coffee grows principially in countries situated within 1,000 miles on either side of the equator (25 degrees north and south latitudes).  Ideal conditions for coffee growth are: 59F-75F year round at an altitude between 1800-6300 feet, with an annual rainfall between 59-118 inches.  Fun fact: the only US state that reliably grows coffee for commercial prodcution is Hawaii.</p>

<p>(map image goes here)</p>

<p>(r: Robusta, m: Both, a: Arabica)</p>

<p><strong>Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia, Columbia</strong> and <strong>Ethiopia</strong> comprise the <strong>top 5</strong> coffee producing countries and represent <strong>65.6%</strong> of total beans sold for export in the world!</p>

<p>Did you know each coffee bush, on average, will produce enough coffee for only <strong>2 pounds</strong> of beans per year?</p>

<h3>
<a name="two-types-of-coffee-beans" class="anchor" href="#two-types-of-coffee-beans"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Two types of coffee beans</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Arabica</strong> :    Coffea arabica is the most cultivated species of coffee grown in the world making up 75 to 80% of the worlds’ coffee, only about 10% of which is considered specialty coffee. Arabica is the highest quality coffee available, must be grown in higher elevations under ideal conditions and produces the most flavorful finished product. Within the subset of Arabica are innumerable varieties of coffee, each with their own characteristics pertaining to tree and bean size, flavor profile, yield per tree and disease resistance, to name a few.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robusta</strong> : Coffea canephora (aka robusta) grows at lower elevations and is less labor intensive to grow. The trees yield more beans and produce a woody, astringent flavor. Robusta beans have 2 times the amount of caffeine and half of the sugar content of Arabica beans. They are used when either a lower price or additional caffeine is desired. Some roasters, particularly Italian espresso roasting companies, add a small amount to add crema and caffeine to their espresso blends.</p></li>

<li> Roasters select the coffee and roast it to perfection.</li>
<li> The baristas at the shops expertly dose, grind and brew the coffee.</li>
<li> The customer enjoys a delicious beverage and all the hard work it took to make it.</li>
</ol><p>*From the time the cherries are picked to when we turn the roasted bean into a drink can be from 3-6 months!</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="intro-to-processing" class="anchor" href="#intro-to-processing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Intro to processing</h2>

<p>The goal of processing coffee is to remove the outer layers of the cherry to prepare the raw green coffee for export and roasting. Each processing method removes these outer layers at different stages of the process and will play an important role in how the coffee will taste.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Bean /seed</strong>: Often referred to as a bean, made of wood cellulose structure.</li>
<li>
<strong>Silver skin</strong>: Thin tissue paper like layer surrounding the seed that comes off during roasting, referred to as chaff.</li>
<li>
<strong>Parchment</strong>: Protective layer surrounding seed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fruit /pulp /mucilage</strong>: If the fruit is removed completely in early stages of processing, it will result in crisper, cleaner coffees, if left on during drying, it can add fruity and sometimes earthy characteristics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Outer skin</strong>: the outer layer of protecting skin.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stalk</strong>: the physical connection of the berry to the plant</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="processing-methods" class="anchor" href="#processing-methods"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Processing methods</h3>

<p><strong>Washed/wet</strong>:
<em>skin, pulp and mucilage are completely removed by friction or fermentation and water prior to drying</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Sorting /rinsing</strong>: the coffee cherries are placed in large tanks of water for density sorting - any cherries that float are removed. The “floaters” are either under-ripe, over-ripe or defective.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mechanical Pulping</strong>: the coffee cherries are loaded into a mechanical de-pulping machine where the coffee cherry is sliced open with either a sharp plastic or metal blade; two beans are pushed out leaving the mucilage outer layer intact.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fermentation</strong>: the pulped coffee is placed in large vats of water anywhere from 6 hours up to 4 days.  The mucilage is broken down in the fermentation vats by naturally present microbes and bacteria.

<ul>
<li>
<em>Note:</em> Mechanical de-mucilagers are newer machines that can remove both the cherry and a large amount of the mucilage, but cannot remove 100% of the mucilage, so often fermentation is still necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Washing</strong>: the remaining pulp is washed off.  The parchment layer remains</li>
<li>
<strong>Drying</strong>: The coffee must then be dried until it’s moisture content is between 10-12%.  A mechanical dryer can be used, or  the sun.  With the sun drying method, coffee will be laid on patios or raised beds and raked/turned regularly to prevent rotting or uneven drying.  This can take from 10 days to 1 month!</li>
<li>
<strong>Resting</strong>: the coffee now needs to stabilize, it is placed in large burlap bags to rest for 2-3 months. </li>
<li>
<strong>Dry Mill</strong>: the coffee is now taken to the Dry Mill where machines are used to remove the parchment layer from the green coffee.</li>
<li>
<strong>Export</strong>: the green coffee is now bagged up and ready for export</li>
</ol><p><strong>Natural/dry process</strong>: <em>the cherries are dried and then the fruit is separated from the bean, this process require less resources (electricity, water) but is more time and labor intensive.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>The cherries are laid out to dry on raised beds or concrete patios

<ul>
<li>Patio drying requires more raking/rotation of the cherries to prevent the cherries from fermenting, spoiling or drying unevenly, BUT more of the cherries can be dried simultaneously.</li>
<li>Raised beds allow for extra air flow so rotation does not need to be done as often, but there is less space to dry large quantities of coffee</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the cherries have reached 9% to 10% humidity, they are put through a husker to remove the dried skin and fruit.</li>
<li>The coffee is now bagged and sent off for it’s final milling to remove the parchment.</li>
</ol><p><em>This process highlights the fruit flavors in the coffee</em></p>

<p><strong>Hybrid processes</strong> : <em>These are hybrid methods because they use techniques from both the washed and natural processes to strip a coffee cherry of its layers.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pulped-natural/honeyed</strong>: the skin is removed and the pulp is left to dry on the bean.

<ol>
<li>The outer layer of the coffee cherry is removed but the mucilage remains.</li>
<li>The coffee is then sun-dried to 9 to 10% humidity.</li>
<li>The coffee is bagged, ready for the final milling.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul><p><em>This process adds sweetness to the finished cup.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Semi-washed/wet hulled</strong>: the skin and pulp are removed, the beans with parchment on are semi-dried, the parchment is removed and then the bean is dried the rest of the way.

<ol>
<li>The skin and the fruit are removed.</li>
<li>The coffee in parchment is partially dried then wet-hulled - meaning the parchment layer is removed before fully dried, to reveal a swollen seed, that appears to be white in color.</li>
<li>The exposed seed is then fully dried and turns to a deep blueish hue.</li>
<li>The coffee is now ready to be bagged and exported.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Check it:</strong> It takes 4000 coffee beans (2000) cherries to yield 1 pound of roasted coffee.</p>

<h3>
<a name="so-whats-up-with-decaf" class="anchor" href="#so-whats-up-with-decaf"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So what’s up with DECAF?</h3>

<p>There are ways to remove caffeine from the bean. These methods remove up to 99% of the naturally existing caffeine. Decaffeination is done to the green bean (after the coffee has been dried and before it is roasted).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conventional Method</strong>: This process removes caffeine by soaking the beans in a food grade chemical solvent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swiss Water Method</strong>: This process begins by soaking the beans in hot water. The hot water, after drawing out the flavor of the beans, is run through a carbon filter, which traps and removes about 99% of the caffeine. New beans are then added to this water. Because the water is already saturated in coffee flavor, only the caffeine is drawn out of these beans while the flavor of the coffee is preserved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CO2 Method</strong>: This process decaffeinates the bean with liquid carbon dioxide, which can be pressurized and chilled acting like a gas and a liquid combined. The equipment needed for this process is so large that it is difficult to accommodate smaller batches. This is generally used for volume not for taste.</p></li>

<a name="basics-of-brewing-extraction" class="anchor" href="#basics-of-brewing-extraction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basics of brewing (extraction)</h3>

<p><strong>There are many variables that can effect the extraction of the coffee</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Water temperature, dose, grind size, time/rate of extraction, agitation, and water composition to name a few.</p></li>
<li><p>When you brew coffee the water is extracts solids from the ground coffee. It is possible to extract too many of these dissolvable solids as well as not enough (over extracted vs. under extracted).</p></li>
<li><p>Over extraction tends to yield a cup of coffee that is <strong><em>bitter</em></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Under extraction tends to yield a cup of coffee that is <strong><em>sour</em></strong>.</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>So how do the different variables effect whether our cup of coffee will be over or under extracted???</strong></p>

</table><p><strong>Note</strong>: agitation is not always necessary depending on brew method</p>

<p><strong>Temperature</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Drip coffee typically brews at between 195 and 205 Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Espresso should generally be around 200F +/- 2F.</li>
<li>Remember 212F (100C) is boiling for water at sea level; coffee should always be brewed at a temperature at least 7 degrees Fahrenheit below boil, so if in doubt measure use a thermometer or let it cool down for a minute.</li>
</ul><hr><h2>
<a name="the-grind" class="anchor" href="#the-grind"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Grind</h2>

<p>The grind is arguably the most important variable in all of coffee extraction, and is certainly the most important starting variable in espresso.</p>

<p><strong>Most coffee shops have several different grinders:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The espresso grinder</li>
<li>The pour over grinder</li>
<li>The batch grinder (for larger commercial brew batches)</li>
</ul><p>These grinders all have one thing in common to differentiate themselves from the common home "whirling blade" spice grinder; they have high quality stamped or forged steel "burr sets".  The purpose of these large tough burr sets is an even and consistent grind as this is the starting point for consistent high quality coffee brewing.</p>

<p>All commercial burr grinders will have and adjustment ring (or selector knob) to select a finer or coarser grind.  Some batch grinders will even list suggested grind settings based on coffee type whereas espresso grinders will have a marked locking screw and adjustment ring.</p>

<p>Depending on the method of brewing various grind levels are desired.  For example, a coarser grind is wanted for the French Press where as for espresso a much finer grind is needed, with drip brewing usually being somewhere in between but probably closer to French Press than espresso grind.</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="espresso" class="anchor" href="#espresso"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ESPRESSO!!!</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Espresso (/ɛˈsprɛsoʊ/; Italian pronunciation: [eˈsprɛsso]) is coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).</p>

<p>Well, yes and no. </p>

<p>Once you’ve got it down, you’ll think it’s pretty complicated, but easy. In the meantime there’s a lot to become familiar with and then a lot of practicing, tasting and adjusting to be done. So, let’s get down to it!</p>

<p>To start, let’s get familiar with the espresso machine itself.
The machine we use, a Synesso (manufacturer) Cyncra (model).</p>

<p>(photo of machine here)</p>

<p>Inside the <strong>portafilter</strong> is the <strong>portafilter basket</strong> - the ground coffee is placed in this basket which has small holes on the bottom where the liquid drains through after the water (under 9 Bars/~130 PSI of pressure) passes through the grinds.</p>

<p>Attached to the grouphead is a mesh <strong>screen</strong> and a rubber <strong>gasket</strong>, which helps create a tight seal between the portafilter and the grouphead.</p>

<hr><h5>
<a name="as-you-read-on-remember-that-taste-is-the-most-important-thing" class="anchor" href="#as-you-read-on-remember-that-taste-is-the-most-important-thing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>As you read on remember that <em>TASTE</em> is the most important thing.</h5>

<p>All of the variables and guidelines presented are to help you consistently produce delicious <strong><em>tasting</em></strong> espresso.</p>

<p>Things to look for when extracting espresso:</p>

<ul>
<li>the espresso should start as a “drip, drip” increasing in speed to form a continuous stream that has the look (or viscosity) of warm honey</li>
<li>this “drip, drip” should start around 5-10 seconds</li>
<li>shot times will be between 25-30 seconds</li>
<li>the volume of liquid produced will be between 1.5-2oz and weigh in the neighborhood of 30-35g</li>
<li>your “dose” (how much ground coffee you use) will be between 18-20 grams</li>
<li>this extraction (dry to wet weight) is known as the "brew ratio" so 18g of espresso grounds in and 36g liquid espresso out would be a 50% brew ratio (dry/liquid %).</li>
</ul><h4>
<a name="troubleshooting" class="anchor" href="#troubleshooting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Troubleshooting:</h4>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The “drip, drip” is too slow/takes too long</strong>: in the same way that water can move too quickly or slowly when we brew drip coffee, it can happen with espresso as well. If you imagine a container full of pebbles and one full of sand, you pour water over both - in which container does the water more through quickly, in which does it pass through more slowly? We can relate this to coffee by thinking about the size of the ground particle. If the particle size is too big (coarse), the water will move through too quickly. If the particle size is too small (fine), the water will move through too slowly.</p>

<p>So, in this case, if the “drip, drip” is too slow which means that the water is moving through the grinds too slowly - the grind size is too fine. To resolve this, we can adjust the grinder to make the particle size more coarse.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>There is no “drip, drip”, it is actually a gushing stream</strong>: this would mead the water is moving too quickly through the grinds, soooooo - we must tighten up the grind (make the particle size smaller/finer)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The shot tastes/feels really thin/watery</strong> - this would mean that the coffee-to-water ration is not balanced, there is not enough coffee being used. Here we would increase the dose by a small amount (like .5g-1g). It is important to remember that when we change the dose amount, there is a good chance the grind will need to be adjusted as well BUT ONLY MAKE ONE CHANGE AT A TIME.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The shot tastes/feels thick</strong>: as above the coffee-to-water balance is off. This time, with too much coffee, so we will need to decrease the dose amount. Remember small adjustments and only make one change at a time. There is a good chance that when you decrease dose amount, you will need to adjust the grinder to produce a finer grind since the water now has less ground coffee to move through.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The shot tastes bitter</strong>: remember bitter = over extraction. This could be because the shot ran too long, there was too little coffee, the grind size was too small, the water temperature was too hot...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The shot tastes sour</strong>: sour = under extraction. This could mean the shot ran too fast, there’s too much coffee, the particle size was too large, the water temperature was too low...</p></li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="grooming-and-tamping" class="anchor" href="#grooming-and-tamping"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grooming and Tamping</h3>

<p>It is important to fill all holes when grooming and tamping to press out any potential air pockets. You’ll want the tamp to be nice and even so the water moves through all the puck uniformly. When there are air pockets in the puck “channeling” can occur. This happens when the water runs through the coffee unevenly - air pockets create a lower point of resistance, so the water will move through it more quickly and in greater amounts.</p>
